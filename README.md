# About
This is a simple program in python using requests to go to the UK version of costco's site and grab the items off of the page. 

# Using Different URL's 
To use different URL's, change the urls in the url_list variable or add multiple URL's to the list. In a future update I might include having 
the script import a csv file with the URL's added to it (if one is available, and if not it would create one.)
